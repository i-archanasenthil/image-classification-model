Torchvision is a library within the PyTorch Machine Learning Framework. This package includes popular datasets, pre-trained model architectures, and common image transformations used in computer vision. It provides various classes to perform image preprocessing and augmentation.

In the linked GitHub repository, image classification is performed using ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 (Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition). These models are pretrained on ImageNet, and their output layers are replaced to match the number of target classes for multi-class classification.

During the forward pass (prediction), the model computes logits, and the cross-entropy loss measures how far the predictions deviate from the actual labels.

The Adam optimizer is used to update model parameters. Using backpropagation, gradients are computed, and the model parameters are updated accordingly. The optimizer also clears the gradients from the previous batch to prevent accumulation.
